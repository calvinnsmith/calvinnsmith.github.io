Welcome to the perfect beginners guide to Git and Github! :)


Imagine you are working on a coding project for developing a website. You create a folder on your computer where all the necessary files for running the website will be stored.
You begin the project by creating your first file and then you start coding! If you have any experience of coding you know that it can be a tedious process with lots of trial and error. Often the programs are built incrementally
which means that bugs are likely to be introduced as you go along and it can be important to keep track of changes that you have made. Every time you make a change, the program might stop working for some reason and you might want to "go back" to the previous version. Another big part of coding is exploring new features and improving your 
existing program. You might want to try a new function for developing a feature. Or, you might want to improve the efficiency of your program by replacing a few lines of code. Exploring and improving is a necessary part of creating a succesful coding project, but you are simultaneously risking messing everything up as you go along.
Further, you are often collaborating with other people on the same project or on parts of the same project. So you want to be able to make changes without interferring with other peoples work and you want to be able to track what other people have contributed with.

To summarize, you want to be able to:

1. Keep track of and store different versions of your program.
2. Work on new features without interferring with the current version of the program.
3. To collaborate with other people on the project.

This is where **Git** and **GitHub** make their grandiose entry, flying in on a helicopter with bullets spraying through the air to save the day! 

Let's start with Git.

## Git
Git is a free and open source **version control** system that lets you track changes in computer files. It is by far the most popular version control system that exists. It is used
by virtually every software development team on the planet. If you are looking too work in tech, you should definitely try to learn more about Git.

First of all, in order to use Git you need to <a href = "https://git-scm.com/downloads">download</a> it on your computer.

After downloading Git you can either open a terminal window or a Git Bash window. The Git bash window comes with downloading git and you can search for it in your seatch bar. It can be a good idea to configure your Git profile by adding your name and email.
This is mostly important when collaborating on projects with other people so that you can track who has done what:

**Set username:**
```
git config --global user.name "Calvin Smith"
```

**Set email:**
```
git config --global user.email datasciencewithcalvin@gmail.com
```
