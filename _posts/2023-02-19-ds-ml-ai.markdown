The multiverse of data science, machine learning and AI can be difficult to navigate. The fields are fundamnetally different (even though they overlap in a lot of ways)
but are often used interchangeably. In this blog post I will try to explain the differences between data science, machine learning and AI and how they relate to each other.

#### Data Science

**Data Science** is a subject or field based on mathematics, statistics and computer science. It is essentially the field that explores how statistics and computer science
can be combined to gain insights, draw conclusions and learn from data. 

#### Machine Learning

**Machine Learning** is the concept of using **data** and a **model** to learn the relationships of the data. 

#### AI
