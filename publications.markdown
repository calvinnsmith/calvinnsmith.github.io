The project investigates how well the machine learning model BERT, in comparison to a naive Bayes classifier, 
can distinguish between written and spoken language and whether there is a difference in BERT’s ability to predict masked words for both classes. 
An interesting result is that the naive Bayes classifier outperformed BERT at classifying spoken sentences. 
Further, the masked word predictions showed that BERT performed poorly at predicting masked words common in spoken language and uncommon in written language, implying that BERT has a lesser understanding of spoken language. The project has contributed to understanding the behavior of pre-trained language models.

The aim of this project was to examine and develop statistical methods for analyzing clinical
stability studies with longitudinal data at Mölnlycke Health Care (MHC). 
We especially focused on developing a method for computing the process performance index Ppk, and we investigated the effects ,
with regards to change in Ppk, of introducing an interaction between time and batch in MHC:s models. 
A large simulation study was conducted to analyze the effects of time and batch in MHC:models. 
The project resulted in MHC implementing a new way of of analyzing their stability studies.

### <a href="https://calvinnsmith.github.io/assets/pdfs/volvo.pdf">Open set recognition with neural networks</a>

<a href="url"><img src="/assets/images/volvo.png" height="auto" width="400" style="border-radius:10%"></a>

This project was part of a course at Chalmers and consisted of an open set recognition problem at Volvo Cars. 
The task was to develop a method for detecting outliers from the output of a feed- forward neural network trained on a specific set of classes. 
In the project, we implemented several machine learning methods for outlier detection such as DBSCAN, Isolation Forest and MDA.

- Python: Pandas, Sklearn
- R: Tidyverse
- DBSCAN, Isolation Forest, MDA.
